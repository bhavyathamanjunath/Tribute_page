          Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century.

          Born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg in the German Empire, Einstein moved to Switzerland in his early 20s and later renounced his German citizenship. He taught himself mathematics and theoretical physics while working at a patent office in Bern.

          In 1905, he had four papers published in the Annalen der Physik, one of which outlined his theory of special relativity. In 1915, he completed his theory of general relativity, which he considered to be his masterpiece. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.

          Einstein's work also had a major impact on the development of atomic energy. He was a vocal pacifist and supporter of international cooperation, and his political views led him to emigrate from Germany to the United States in 1933. He became a citizen in 1940 and worked at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton until his death in 1955.

        <blockquote>
          "The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery every day. Never lose a holy curiosity."
